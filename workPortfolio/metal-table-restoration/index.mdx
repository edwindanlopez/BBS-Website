This patio aluminum table had been heavily damaged due to the weather and
humidity. In order to restore this, the table had to be completely sanded down.
A couple of layers of protective coatings were applied to seal the metal. Then,
the artwork was painted on top to bring it to life, and sealed with one final
layer of top coat.
