Finding a vanity that does not fall into the standard categories offered by
stores can be hard and pricey. This 52 inches-long cabinet was refurbished and
cut down to 42 inches and a slide shelf was added to fill up the gap left by the
disappearance of the drawers on one of the sides. It saved a couple of hundreds
of dollars to the homeowner.
