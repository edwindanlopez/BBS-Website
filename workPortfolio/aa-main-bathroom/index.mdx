Still a work in progress, in this bathroom a full-size fiberglass shower was replaced with a tub and large porcelain tile. Instead of buying a new 42-inches vanity, we refurbished and adapted an old one saving the family a couple of hundreds of dollars. The new look is contemporary and much more spacious.
