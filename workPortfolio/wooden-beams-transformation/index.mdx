These wooden beams had been previously painted flat, covering their natural
look. Sanding down to bare wood was NOT an option for the client. The objective
was to recover the color, grain, and look of the original wood. Several layers
of paint washes, knot textures, and color fades were applied in order to bring
the beams and columns to life.
